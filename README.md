	This project is done as the final project of the Y1 module H61RTS_Introduction_to_real_time_system.
	
	The objective of the project is designing and constructing a real time signal generator/processor based on the microcontroller pic18f87j11.
	
	The following functions are implemented in the system:
		Menu system with switch/potentialmeter control
		Signal generator capable of producing four types of waveform with different frequencies.
		Signal processor capable of filtering or multiplexing input signal with various schemes.
